### Hi ðŸ‘‹
### I'm an indie game-dev from Italy.
I create games and sometimes other software. I've been a modder since I was a kid and then started my journey as a game dev in 2017. I've been making prototypes and simple games starting with GameMaker Studio 2 then made the switch to Godot in 2019. I'm also a composer, since I also make the music for my games. Some of my work is free and open-source while some of them are just prototypes that you can try. This GitHub profile is for my other works, being it game-dev related or not.

### Known languages
- Python
- C#
- Lua
- GDScript (For Godot Engine)
